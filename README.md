# Project: Todo Manager using Angular

Welcome to the **Todo Manager** project built using Angular! This project provides a user-friendly interface for managing your daily tasks and to-dos. With its simple design and intuitive functionality, you can easily add and delete tasks. The project utilizes Angular's powerful features, including `ngFor`, `ngIf`, `ngModel`, `FormsModule`, `EventEmitter`, and error handling. Through this project, you will not only gain proficiency in Angular but also deepen your understanding of core concepts such as data binding, event handling, and local storage usage.

## Introduction

The **Todo Manager** project is a web application that allows users to create, manage, and organize their to-do list. The application is built entirely in Angular, a popular front-end framework that offers a structured and modular approach to building dynamic web applications. The project leverages Angular's capabilities to create a seamless and responsive user experience.

## Features

1. **Add Todos**: Easily add new tasks to your to-do list by typing in the task description and hitting the "Add" button. The newly added task will appear in the list.

2. **Delete Todos**: When a task is completed or no longer relevant, you can remove it from your list by clicking the "Delete" button associated with that task. The task will be instantly removed from the display.

3. **Persistent Storage**: The project takes advantage of browser's `localStorage` to store your to-do list data locally. This means that even if you close the browser or refresh the page, your tasks will be retained until you choose to delete them.

## Learning Objectives

By working on this project, you will gain practical experience in several important aspects of Angular development:

- **ngFor**: Learn how to use the `ngFor` directive to iterate through an array of tasks and dynamically display them in the user interface.

- **ngIf**: Understand how to use the `ngIf` directive to conditionally render elements, such as displaying a "Delete" button only when a task is present.

- **ngModel and FormsModule**: Explore two-way data binding with `ngModel` and learn how to use the `FormsModule` to manage form inputs and track changes.

- **EventEmitter and Event Handling**: Learn how to use `EventEmitter` to create custom events and manage event listeners for user interactions.

- **Error Solving**: Encounter and solve common issues that arise during Angular development, enhancing your problem-solving skills.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory using a command-line interface.
3. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
4. Run `ng serve` to start the development server.
5. Access the application in your web browser by visiting `http://localhost:4200`.

## Disclaimer

Please note that the **Todo Manager** project stores your to-do list data in the browser's `localStorage`. Be aware that if you clear your browser's local storage, all your to-do list data will be permanently lost.

Feel free to explore, experiment, and make this project your own. Happy learning and happy coding!
